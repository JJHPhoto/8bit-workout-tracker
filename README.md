## Application Demo

To watch a video of the application being fully demo'd please use this link: [Application Demo](...).

## Workflow

- initial ideas
- hard coding until i get it to click. stopped at stats & style css. i had been using chartsjs to do my project 2 charts and was familiar enough.
- back end connecting via class demos
- I realized I had made mistakes hard coding my public folder. I decided to copy in the given code after working on it with my study group. I'm glad I hand coded it because it did help me better understand how things were connected. I just made a few mistakes with missing letters in a few spots.
